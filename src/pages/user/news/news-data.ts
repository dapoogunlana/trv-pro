So if you are planning a long-term mining deal, then go for these high configuration machines as soon as you can.

Consider reading this post about cryptocurrency trading where we mentioned the criteria to look for when choosing an ideal cryptocurrency wallet.
                There are two kinds of wallet for you to choose from. You can decide to go for a full wallet which has a Bitcoin Core code integrated within it. This wallet is preferable to those that have some space on their computers as it consumes much space. However, it is safer and gives you a complete control of your mined assets.
                The other, a lightweight wallet only stores your assets’ transactions and is managed by an outside decentralized application. Get the Bitcoin Core here and set up a password for your wallet as you install the core. Remember to have a copy of this wallet saved elsewhere (outside your mining computer) so as to be on a safe side in case of system crash. Exodus is another wallet that you can use. The advantage of this is that it can manage multiple currencies.`,

                point: `In the beginning, miners enjoyed mining BTC individually without joining hands with one another. Today, that is no more a profitable move. There are thousands of large computer rigs mining BTC constantly. Competing with these already established computing powers is not an easy task. In order to make outstanding profits in mining Bitcoin, it is required that you join a mining pool.
                Think of a Bitcoin Mining Pool as a group of miners contributing their computing resources to bring about a powerful mining rig, strong enough to compete with the already established mining rigs on the Bitcoin network. Here, when Bitcoin coins are mined, they are shared among the participants in a ratio dependent on their contributed computing power.
                Perhaps the amount of BTC acquired by the individuals here is lower; however, it is more consistent and requires less investment. On most mining pools, the rigs operator get between 1 and 2% of the total BTC mined.`,

In January, 2019, an unidentified hacker somehow managed to gain control of a whopping 51% of the computers on the Ethereum Classic blockchain. How managed! How could he do that? How the hell did some random hacker gain control of around a thousand computer systems that are sparsely situated in different locations across the globe and broke the mighty blockchain self-security? These have become the buzzing discussions in the blockchain communities with many unanswered questions being raised about the legibility of the blockchain technology security.
                The said attacker had pulled over $1 million worth of ETC coin before he was spotted by the security protocol of the number one cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. What this individual did was performing what we call “double spend”. To do this, he first gained the control of over half of the computing power being used by the blockchain, meaning he could use around a thousand computers from the Ethereum Classic blockchain to rewrite transaction history, thereby spending the same cryptocurrency more than once.
                Coinbase was able to protect the Ethereum Classic coin from being stolen from its exchange courtesy of its dreadful security protocols. However, another exchange, Gate.io was not that lucky, loosing around $200,000 to the same attacker, who mysteriously returned half of the stolen money. Hackers are crazy! Well, Techreview’s article written by Mike Orcutt analyzes more on the 51% rule.`,

Technology has its way of bringing solutions to all problems, the very reason it keeps evolving and shifting boundaries. Today, Bitcoin can easily be spent, transferred (send and receive) and stored thanks to entities like Bitcoin wallets, Bitcoin debit cards and the likes. Surely, it is the same with other cryptocurrencies.
                If you are planning on taking this business of cryptocurrency trading as serious as the successful people, then you need to learn about everything related to it. cold wallets, hot wallets, online wallets, etc sound strange, to be honest, until you take your time to look deeply into them.`,

The four main types are the hardware Bitcoin wallets, mobile Bitcoin wallets, desktop Bitcoin wallets and web Bitcoin wallets. However, there are various other classes that we can put a wallet in. In other to get the best picture of this, perhaps we can use the classification types.
                Bitcoin wallets are easily classified into categories, this time different from types based on some features. In addition to what we have in the types, the classification category brings others like paper Bitcoin wallets, hot Bitcoin wallets, cold Bitcoin wallets as well as custodial and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.
                Let us start with Bitcoin wallets classification based on coin custodial
                There are two types under this category. These are the custodial Bitcoin wallets and non-custodial Bitcoin wallets.`,

This is what we see in top exchange including Binance, Coinbase, Robinhood, Huobi and many others.  These exchanges require users to trust them with their cryptocurrencies. As such exchanges have in them centralized wallets for users to hold their coins; such wallets become what we term coin custodian wallet.

                The strength of this wallet is it solves security issues that are encountered on coin custodian wallets. If you have been following the cryptocurrency industry for a while, you should have learned about the various hacking attacks on exchanges that have seen billions of USD lost in the processes. Nonetheless, non-custodian wallets cannot be hacked since there is no centralized server for coin holding.

                This happens to be the major wallets classification as it consists the main types of Bitcoin wallets.

                Mobile wallets take the significant portion in the global digital assets wallets space.

                For some reasons, many users prefer this due to the intuitive interfaces and reach features. However, using a desktop wallet does not necessarily stop you from having one installed on your mobile device too.

                Web Bitcoin wallets hold your keys, seeds and digital assets. They are mostly coin-custodian although we have some that are decentralized exchanges (DEX). Such do not hold your assets. Example of web Bitcoin wallets are Coinbase, Green Address and Xapo.`,

Paper wallets are offline wallets and give the users the total control of their assets.

No need of paying a commission fee to a house broker, bank or lawyer; no place for a delay, things get going as programmed.
